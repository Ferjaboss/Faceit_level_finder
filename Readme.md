# My Project
So it all started when i was in a matchmaking and my oponents were so good so i started looking for their faceit level on some website it took me a lot of time to fetch each players data so i thought why don't i make my own program that fetches all the players faceit level with one click 
* in this Project ive used the FACEIT API and the STEAM API to fetch the data from the internet then when the user input the status command returned data
python will automatically parse the data and retrieve all the players steamID64 from their SteamID then will call a faceit API to fetch their levels 
## Next Update:
Im planing either on integrating this into csgo directly where the user execute an exec cmd or use some library like tkinter or pyqt5 to make a gui
## Requirements
python3 
## Installation
pull this repository or just download the zip file
run pip install request
then run the main.py
